# The Hampel Filter detects and removes the outliers of the input signal by using the Hampel
# identifier. The Hampel identifier is a variation of the three-sigma rule of statistics,
# which is robust against outliers. For each sample of the input signal, the block computes the
# median of a window composed of the current sample and Lengthâˆ’12 adjacent samples on each side of
# the current sample. Len is the window length you specify through the Window length parameter.
# The block also estimates the standard deviation of each sample about its window median by using
# the median absolute deviation. If a sample differs from the median by more than the threshold
# multiplied by the standard deviation, the filter replaces the sample with the median.
